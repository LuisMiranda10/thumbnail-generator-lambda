# Image Thumbnail Generator using AWS Lambda and S3 Event Notification

This project implements an automatic image thumbnail generator using **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon S3**, **CloudWatch**, and **Terraform**. When a new image is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function is triggered to generate a thumbnail, which is then stored in another S3 bucket. The logs generated by the Lambda function are stored in **CloudWatch** for monitoring and debugging purposes.

This serverless architecture ensures scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Amazon S3**: 
   - The source bucket stores the original images.
   - A destination bucket is used to store the generated thumbnails.

2. **AWS Lambda**:
   - The Lambda function is triggered by an S3 event notification whenever a new image is uploaded to the source bucket.
   - The function processes the image and creates a thumbnail, which is then stored in the destination bucket.

3. **AWS CloudWatch**:
   - All logs from the Lambda function are stored in CloudWatch, allowing you to monitor, debug, and track the function's behavior.

4. **Terraform**:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is used to provision and manage AWS resources, including the S3 buckets, Lambda function, CloudWatch logs, and the event notification system.
